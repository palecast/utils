        <h3>1. What this site provides</h3>
        <p>
          The website at <a href="https://www.duplessis.uk">https://www.duplessis.uk</a>
          (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;) provides a collection of browser-based utility tools
          (the &ldquo;Utilities&rdquo;) for convenience and general information only.
          The Utilities are offered free of charge, without advertising or user tracking, and are
          provided on an &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as available&rdquo; basis.
        </p>

        <h3>2. No guarantee of accuracy or fitness for purpose</h3>
        <p>
          Each Utility has been created in good faith, but no guarantee is given that any
          calculation, conversion, output, or result is correct, complete, up-to-date, or
          suitable for any particular purpose. The Utilities may contain errors, rely on
          third-party data, or behave differently across browsers or devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must not rely on the Utilities as your sole source of information for
          decisions that have financial, legal, safety-critical, or life-critical
          consequences. You are responsible for independently verifying any result if
          accuracy is important.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Use at your own risk</h3>
        <p>
          You use the Site and the Utilities entirely at your own risk. It is your
          responsibility to ensure that any use of the Utilities is appropriate for your
          situation and that your interpretation of any output is sensible and properly
          checked.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Limitation of liability</h3>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Site owner and operator
          shall not be liable for any loss, damage, cost, or consequence of any kind
          (whether direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential) arising out
          of or in connection with:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>your access to or use of the Site or any Utility; or</li>
          <li>your inability to access or use the Site or any Utility; or</li>
          <li>any error, fault, bug, omission, or inaccuracy in any Utility or output.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This limitation of liability applies, without limitation, to any loss of
          profit, business, revenue, opportunity, data, or goodwill.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Free for personal and non-commercial use</h3>
        <p>
          The Utilities are provided free of charge for your personal, non-commercial
          use only. You may:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>use the Utilities directly via the Site; and</li>
          <li>share links to the Site or to individual Utilities with others.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You may not use the Utilities or any output from them as part of a commercial
          service, product, or business activity without the prior written permission of
          the Site owner.
        </p>

        <h3>6. No resale, re-packaging, or redistribution</h3>
        <p>
          Without explicit prior written permission from the Site owner, you may not:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>sell, license, or otherwise commercially exploit the Utilities;</li>
          <li>copy, host, or mirror the Utilities on another domain or platform;</li>
          <li>re-package the Utilities or their underlying code into another product or service;</li>
          <li>distribute modified or unmodified versions of the Utilities as your own tools.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You are, however, welcome to link to the Site or specific Utilities from
          blogs, social media, or other websites, provided that such linking is not
          misleading and is not itself part of a commercial re-sale of the Utilities.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Changes, availability, and maintenance</h3>
        <p>
          The Site owner may update, modify, suspend, or permanently remove any Utility
          or any part of the Site at any time and without prior notice. No guarantee is
          given that any particular Utility will continue to be available or will behave
          in a particular way in the future.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Third-party links and data</h3>
        <p>
          Some Utilities may rely on, or link to, third-party services, APIs, websites,
          or data sources. These are outside the control of the Site owner. No
          responsibility is accepted for the availability, content, accuracy, or
          security of any third-party resource. Your use of any third-party service is
          subject to that third party&rsquo;s own terms and policies.
        </p>

        <h3>9. No legal, financial, or professional advice</h3>
        <p>
          Nothing on the Site, and no output from any Utility, constitutes legal,
          financial, tax, investment, medical, or other professional advice. If you
          require such advice, you should consult an appropriate qualified professional.
        </p>

        <h3>10. Governing law and jurisdiction</h3>
        <p>
          These terms, and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with
          them or their subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes
          or claims), are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
          England and Wales.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive
          jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection
          with these terms or your use of the Site or the Utilities.
        </p>

        <h3>11. Changes to these terms</h3>
        <p>
          The Site owner may revise these terms from time to time by updating this
          page. The version posted here is the current version. By continuing to use
          the Site or the Utilities after any changes are posted, you are deemed to
          accept the revised terms.
